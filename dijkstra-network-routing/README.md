This code uses graphviz to generate graphs that simulate network routers. The network is generated from a matrix of zeroes and ones
which represent the connections between nodes. The weights, that is, the transmission cost between the routers is pseudo-randomly updated after each iteration in order to simulate network usage and overload, after that, the tranmission costs are recalculated.
